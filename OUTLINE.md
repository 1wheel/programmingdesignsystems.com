  - ADD: modular content.
  - ADD: P5.js section

- Form
  - [ ] History of form
  - [x] Canvas and shape
  - [/] Basic Shapes
  - [ ] Custom Shapes
  - [ ] Shape interactions
    - Positive and negative
    - Tension
    - Rhythm
    - Symmetry
    - Clustering and separation
    - Aligning
    - Overlapping
  - [ ] Layout techniques
    - Law of thirds
    - Golden ratio

    - Exponential
    - More from Geometry of design


- Color
  - [ ] History of color
  - [ ] Color models

- Repetition
  - [ ] History of repetition
  - [ ] Basic repetition (I HAVE EXAMPLE IN NOTES)
  - [ ] Column and row repetition
    - Using nested for loops (Paul Rand hearts example)
    - Using randomization (Paul Rand I know example)
    - Using col and row to create gradients / color changes
  - [ ] Recursion and non-repeatable patterns

- Randomization
  - [ ] History of randomization
  - [ ] What is randomization?
    - It's just a number. You choose what you use it for (illustrations with using a number for size or color)


- Grid systems
  - [ ] History of grid systems
  - .... different grids

- Motion
  - [ ] History of motion
  - [ ] Meaning through animation?
  - [ ] Easings?

- Pixel manipulation



Things that currently do not fit:
  - Something about polygons (simple/complex/concave, etc). A definition in geometry.
  - Positive and negative space?
  - Other layout mechanisms than grid systems?
  - Machine learning?
  - Vectors
