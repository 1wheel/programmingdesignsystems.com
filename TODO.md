- The static/dynamic examples are not explained super well. Need color coding and figcaptions. Perhaps I need a piece of text that can explain a bunch of examples at the same time. "The following example produces the same visual, but the latter is much more readable".
- Figure out why code examples start with a space
- Code examples should have the ability to take up full height of parent. Use flexbox?
