  <p>For a long time, the role of a graphic designer was rather easy to define. It meant working with your hands to visually communicate a piece of content in shape and color, ending up with a printed product in the form of e.g. a poster, book cover or business card. Amazingly clever and beautiful art has been created this way.</p>

  <p>However, we find ourselves at an interesting time in the design world, not because this definition of design has changed much, but because the products we're required to build have changed. We now spend a majority of our time looking at screens instead of paper, and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design for digital devices. But digital design is not the same as print design. Creating user interfaces for a mobile application means taking into account a complex set of states for each screen and hundreds of possible transitions between them. Turning a large dataset into a visualization requires hours of time cleaning and sorting the data to find a proper visual representation of the numbers. Most computer games require the use of procedural design techniques because it's simply impossible to design every game object by hand. Common to all of these examples is that none of them can be built using traditional design tools, and all of them require the use of a programming language.</p>
