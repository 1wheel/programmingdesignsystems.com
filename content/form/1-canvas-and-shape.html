  <p>As we begin our journey into the field of graphic design, it's important to start at the very beginning. Graphic design is the art of using form and color to successfully convey a message, but this is not as easy as it sounds. The design process is one of trial and error, and it often takes many iterations to create a design that clearly communicates what you're trying to say. Although we tend to think of this design process as something involving gut instinct, experienced designers have an ever-expanding checklist of visual relationships that helps guide them through to the end.</p>

  <p>The first item on this checklist is learning how to manipulate a single shape to produce desired outcomes. We will investigate how changing three simple variables of a rectangle – the position, size, and rotation – can result in drastically different expressions. Although somehow basic, these variables are an important first set of techniques to be employed at the beginning of every design process, replacing hours of searching through online portfolios of the latest trends in the design world. We will also look at a few related techniques that can help you write flexible, dynamic code.</p>

  <section data-type="sect1">

    <h1>Size</h1>

    <p>The size of a shape is important, as it communicates whether that shape is important or not. By increasing the size of important shapes and decreasing the size of less important shapes, you can bring clarity to a design, and this is a pattern we encounter daily in everything from traffic signs to website dialog boxes.</p>

    <div class="two-grid">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/dominant.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>This square is dominant because it takes up most of the canvas.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/non-dominant.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>This square is less dominant because of the large empty space around it.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>A famous example of sizing in graphic design is Helmut Krone and William Bernbach's <em>Think Small</em> advertising campaign for Volkswagen. In this series of magazine ads, an image of the Volkwagen Beetle is printed in different sizes to emphasize the supporting text copy.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="form/canvas-and-shape/vw-thinksmall.jpg" />
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="form/canvas-and-shape/vw-lemon.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>You can reveal the underlying relationship of sizes by drawing black boxes on top of shapes in existing designs. This will highlight how sizing is an integral part of most successful designs, and how neglecting to think about sizing can lead to cluttered or unorganized layouts.</p>

    <p>TWO DESIGNS WITH BLACK BOXES, ONE SUCCESSFUL AND ONE NOT. BOTH TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING.</p>

    <p>All basic drawing functions in P5.js allows you to specify the size of the shape you're drawing. To draw a rectangle, we use the <code>rect(x, y, width, height)</code> function. In the following example, we draw a rectangle that takes up half the width of canvas.</p>

    <pre class="text-width"><code>createCanvas(500, 500);
rect(0, 0, 250, 500);</code></pre>

    <p>Although this code certainly works, it doesn't really do a good job describing the relationship between the canvas and the rectangle. If I were to change the size of the canvas, the rectangle would no longer span half the canvas. The title of this book, <em>Programming Design Systems</em>, refers to the fact that when we create graphic designs in code, we are not merely drawing something, but programming a system to draw something. It is therefore up to us, the designers, to write our code so it is flexible, easy to understand, and easy to improve upon. In this case, you can make your code more flexible by calculating the size of your rectangle with the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> variables. These variables are created for you by P5.js, and they will always hold the size of the canvas.</p>

    <pre class="text-width"><code>createCanvas(500, 500);
rect(0, 0, width/2, height);</code></pre>

    <p>The code above produces the same result, but it makes sure that the rectangle resizes based on the size of the canvas. This method is used throughout this book, as it's simply good practice, and it will make it easier for you to test variations of your code-based designs.</p>

    <h1>Position</h1>

    <p>Like words in a paragraph of text, the position of a shape indicates the order of the shape in the design. Most written languages have a natural reading direction (english is left to right, arabic right to left), and this can be used to prioritize the importance of shapes, and tell the user where to start reading.</p>

    <p>This pattern is used throughout the design world to create, in lack of a better word, rhythm. Graphic novels use the positioning of captions to guide the reader through the storyline. Newspapers place the most important text in a heading at the top of an article, which also tends to have a larger size to set it apart. Notice also how changing the position of shapes also changes the whitespace between them, which can be used to create both balance and asymmetry.</p>

    <div class="two-grid">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/left.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>First, because of reading direction.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/right.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>Last, because of reading direction.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>In these posters for Swiss Auto Club, Joseph Müller-Brockmann uses both position and size to prioritize certain shapes. On the left, the vehicle is emphasized to heighten the tension, making it apparent that the vehicle is on a collision course with the kid. On the right, the bicycle is emphasized to achieve the exact opposite.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="form/canvas-and-shape/brockmann-motorbike.jpg" />
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="form/canvas-and-shape/brockmann-bicycle.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>P5.js uses a coordinate system to position shapes in 2D space, as do most other graphics programming languages. In the following example, we draw a rectangle near the bottom right of the canvas.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <div class="col">
        {% codesplit form/canvas-and-shape/use-variables-wrong.js lines:'8' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/use-variables-wrong.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>However, now that we need to calculate numbers for both size and position of the rectangle, things are starting to look a little cluttered, and the code has become hard to read. To solve this problem, it is often helpful to use variables at the top of your code to store these numbers. This not only makes the code more readable, but it also makes it easier to test variations of your design. The following example results in the exact same design, but each of the numbers are now saved into a variable.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <div class="col">
        {% codesplit form/canvas-and-shape/use-variables-right.js lines:'6-10,13' %}
      </div>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/use-variables-right.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <h1>Rotation</h1>

    <p>A third important relationship relates to the rotation of shapes. Rotation can be used to make shapes come alive, as the whitespace around them becomes more complex and breaks the symmetry of the design.</p>

    <div class="three-grid">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/rotation1.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>A rectangle with no rotation appears static because of the symmetric whitespace.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/rotation2.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>A rotation of 45&deg; creates more complex – but still symmetric – whitespace.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/rotation3.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>A rotation of 27&deg; breaks the symmetry, and the rectangle appears in motion.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Rotation is used in many types of design products: Children's books use rotated shapes to make them look fun and playful. Popular magazines use rotated grid systems to make the content look less dry, while publications for a narrow target audience use horizontal grid systems to imply quality of the content within.</p>

    <p>EXAMPLE: Paul Rand uses squares with different rotations to make a playful cover for a children's book.</p>

    <p>EXAMPLE: Josef muller brockman: 45 degree rotations. streamlined and digital.</p>

    <p>In code, we define rotation as a number between 0 and 360 (degrees), often converted to a number between 0 and 6.28318530718 (radians) with the <code>radians()</code> function. It is important to understand how graphic programming languages – and P5.js in particular – applies rotation to shapes. When you use the <code>rotate()</code> function, you are actually rotating the entire coordinate system, and all shapes drawn after this rotation will be drawn in the rotated coordinate system.</p>

    <div class="commentator">
      {% codesplit form/canvas-and-shape/coordinates.js lines:'11-17' %}
      <figure>{% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/coordinates.js class:'fig' %}</figure>
    </div>

    <div class="commentator">
      {% codesplit form/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-rotated.js lines:'6-12,17' %}
      <figure>{% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-rotated.js class:'fig' %}</figure>
    </div>

    <div class="commentator">
      {% codesplit form/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-translated.js lines:'6-13,18' %}
      <figure>{% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-translated.js class:'fig' %}</figure>
    </div>

      <figure>{% p5 form/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-translated-rotated.js class:'fig' %}</figure>
    </div>

    <p>As we dive into more layout techniques, we will further investigate how to use <code>translate()</code> and <code>rotate()</code> to make more sophisticated designs.</p>

    <h1>Designing a word</h1>magicb

    <p>By constraining yourself to just a rectangle and these three variables, you will train one of the most fundamental skills in design: Seeing visual relationships. The following examples of designs for a single word will give you some idea of what the result might look like.</p>

    <p>SHOW WORD/DESIGN GRID</p>

    <p>Although this is just our first step into the world of graphic design, many extra-ordinary works of art have been created using this approach.</p>

    <p>GRAPHIC DESIGN EXAMPLES</p>

    <p>It's common to find problems in existing designs that can be traced back to the use of position, size, and rotation. Whether it's a user interface that fails to emphasize an important button, or a graph with ambiguity around its underlying dataset, it's clear that some designers rush to make things pretty without thinking about these basic relationships. This should be seen as a failure of design, and one is much better off including these ideas as a vital part of any design process.</p>
