Shapes have characteristics on their own that can be used to create meaningful relationships in a design. Although we cannot ascribe absolute meaning to any of them, we have a natural intuition towards them, shaped by a long history of cultural symbolism and iconology. If asked to depict a sun, very few people would start by drawing a rectangle. It's important to be able to see these characteristics in order to know what types of shapes to use in different scenarios, and one of the best ways to do this is by practicing with basic shapes.

RECT - ELLIPSE - TRIANGLE

Let's spend a moment looking at these three shapes and their characteristics.


## The rectangle

The rectangle is a symmetric, solid shape with parallel lines. Not overly present in nature, it is the symbol of civilization itself, with a presence in almost every handmade object. We build cities in rectangular grids, houses as cubes with bricks, and our interiors are rectangles too: doors, shelves, and windows.

The rectangle is used throughout the history of the arts to set up basic constraints for the artist, with rectangular canvasses and grid systems to further divide this canvas into smaller squares. With the advent of computers, we use rectangular screens, and operate with a square as the smallest visual denomination: The pixel.

## The ellipse

The ellipse has characteristics opposite to that of the rectangle. It's a smooth, organic shape found many places in nature, in the shape of the sun, planets, raindrops, and the eyes of most animals. There is something calming in the shape of a circle, emphasizing no sense of direction. Human beings tend to gather in circles when trying to unite: We dance in circles, and design the seating of most parliaments in elliptical arrangements.

## The triangle

The triangle is an asymmetric shape, which makes it unique among the basic shapes for its directionality and sense of movement. It is commonly known as the symbol for both masculinity (▲) and femininity (▼), and it is widely used for its aesthetic qualitites. The great pyramids in Giza are famous depictions of the triangle, thought to act as both a symbol for the life-giving rays of the sun, and as a giant arrow pointing towards the assumed center of rotation of the stars, to which the Egyptians ascribed godly qualities.

The triangle is also a symbol of Euclidian geometry, thus for mathematics itself, and it serves as the foundation for modern 2D and 3D graphics.

## An ice cream cone

We can use this knowledge to make good decisions in our design process, picking shapes that make sense for each piece of content. This is of course a skill that needs to be practiced for it to be developed, and starting with just the basic shapes makes sense in the same way that it does for a chess player to practice openings. You develop a solid foundation upon which to build a game.


FIRST ASSIGNMENT, ICE CREAM CONE.


Take a look at the two illustrations below. It doesn't require much effort to see that the one on the left looks the most like an ice cream cone. We can objectively say that it's the best design, even though the two designs use exactly the same shapes. From this we can extrapolate another thing: It is the relationship between shapes of different types that is important.

Text on first assignment, ice cream cone.... (despite the simplicity, students solve it in many ways. Good example of how creative graphic design can be)

This is one of the first assignments I give my design students: Design an ice cream cone in black and white using only `rect()`, `triangle()` and `ellipse()` once in your code.

After seeing hundreds of solutions to this simple assignment, I believe there is an almost infinite number of ways to solve this design problem. However, they tend to fit into a few categories.

There's an iconic category with designs that illustrate the pure, iconic form of the cone. This is often done by using properly proportioned shapes and aligning them at the center of the canvas.

MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS CATEGORY

ADD REALISTIC CATEGORY. DESIGNS THAT LOOK LIKE A DRAWING.

There's an abstract category with designs, often done by more trained designers, who choose a more playful approach. These designs are often more subjective, because the individual style of each designer start to emerge.

ABSTRACT EXAMPLES

Even though this is a very simple assignment, many students explore the possibilities of the medium, using `for` loops to create designs that are uniquely computational. (something about "interesting", and links to repetition and randomization).

LUISA, OTHER EXAMPLES OF DESIGN SYSTEM.

In all of the categories above, our [basic variables](#) are used to solve the assignment in some way or another, using the characteristics of the basic shapes. Even though this exercise seems pretty xxxx from the work real designers do, many successful designs were created solely by choosing the right shapes for the content.

Something about the exercise, "design a word"

balance - sharp, etc... Same words as first article

... it's a worthwhile things to practice before moving on to more complex systems.
