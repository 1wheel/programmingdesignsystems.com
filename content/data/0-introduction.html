  <p>The word <em>data</em> seems to be everywhere these days. Data science, data visualization, data finance. All these new terms all try to grapple with the same basic fact that computers have an accelerating on everything on earth, from economics to ???. This comes with a pretty significant side effect, which is the massive amounts of data generated by these computers. Every time you visit a website, buy something online, or go to the doctor, somewhere a computer is storing that information in a file. Naturally, we want to make sense of all this information. Websites want to see a list of their most popular content, businesses want to know who is buying what, and doctors want to find patterns in their data to try to prevent future deceases. This task requires two things: the technical understanding to parse this data into meaningful statistics, and the design talent to turn the statistics into a meaningful form that everyone understands.</p>

  <p>Although this amount of data is something new, designers have been confronted with these problems for centuries. HISTORY.</p>

  <p>History!</p>
