For a long time, the role of a graphic designer was rather easy to define. It meant working with your hands to visually communicate a piece of content in shape and color, a process that often ended with a printed product in the form of a poster, book cover or business card. Amazingly clever and beautiful art has been created this way.

However, we find ourselves at an interesting time in the design world, not because this definition of design has changed much, but because the products we're required to build have changed. Many people now spend a majority of their time looking at screens instead of paper, and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design these digital products. Designing user interfaces for a mobile application means taking into account a complex set of states for each screen and hundreds of possible transitions between them. Turning a large dataset into a data visualization requires hours of time cleaning and sorting the data to find a proper visual representation of the numbers. Most computer game designers use procedural design techniques, because it's simply impossible to design every game object by hand. Common to all of these examples is that none of them can be built using traditional design tools, and all of them require the use of a programming language.

For a field rooted in the fine arts, this has been a difficult transition. Many graphic design schools still teach processes inherited from the printed page, and this institutionalizes designers to think of themselves as creatives who come up with concepts for others to execute. Paul Rand famously said *&ldquo;Itâ€™s important to use your hands. This is what distinguishes you from a cow or a computer operator&rdquo;*^[Michael Kroeger, *Paul Rand: Conversations with Students* (2008)]), but this divide is highly problematic when building products that simply cannot be prototyped using tools like Photoshop or Sketch, and it threatens to turn designers into luddites. Although these traditions from the fine arts is a great positive, and this very book builds upon that foundation, there is a century-long bond between the field of design and advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will simply become irrelevant.

This book is the result of a simple question: What happens when we try to redefine the graphic design curriculum using a programming language as the tool for the designer? It teaches you how to make designs in code, and how to evaluate the success of these designs.

I am not the first author to write about systems in graphic design, and this book builds upon ideas from many incredible authors who are too numerous to mention. I am not the first author to write about code and graphic design either, but I've been frustrated by books on the subject that seem to fall in two categories: Books with a heavy focus on code and generative design that do not teach graphic design principles at all, and books celebrating computational design as a spectacle without identifying how projects are made or why they are successful. This is a book that tries to bridge the two important fields of graphic design and computer science simply because we have the ability to write code that produces beautiful designs, and the designer of tomorrow will have to understand how to deliver on that promise. The book is written for both programmers wanting to become better designers and designers wanting to use a programming language in the design process. Although the examples from the book can be embedded on any web page, it is important to note that this is not a book about web design. This book aims to teach designers how to create visual designs in code, but these techniques can be applied to both digital and print work. In fact, I have seen my students produce many types of design projects over the years, including sculpture, painting, fashion design, photography, web design, game design, and print design.

The book is structured around the basic elements of visual design (form, color, typography, grid systems, etc) with concrete examples to demonstrate how to use these elements. As you go through the text, you will notice that it starts with the very basics. The code will be simple and the exercises will be very constrained. If this feels simplistic, keep reading. We will soon enough touch upon more challenging themes, but these basic concepts lay the foundation for some of the more complex ideas.

P5.jS HERE!
The text is written for readers with an introductory knowledge of programming in JavaScript, which means that little time will be devoted to explaining concepts like variables, functions, and loops. For this audience, I highly recommend Daniel Shiffman's [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) on the subject, where Dan does a much better job at explaining these concepts than I ever could. Although the examples are created using [P5.js](http://p5js.org), I have tried to write the text to be as general as possible, and all concepts should easily be portable to whatever graphics programming language you prefer.

I have chosen to publish this book for free online without a publisher. The main reason for this is freedom, as it allows me to write and design the book according to my own preference. This shows in the structure of the book, which consists of many shorter chapters that makes it better to read on the web. It also makes it easier for teachers to remix chapters for use in classrooms (which is completely legal and free because of the Creative Commons license). I will be writing these chapters in a non-linear fashion, working on the topics that I find the most interesting at the given time. There is no concrete deadline for the finished book, although I am pursuing it as a full-time endeavor. The full source code for this book is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/runemadsen/programmingdesignsystems.com/tree/master/content).

I would like to thank a group of people, without whom this book would never have existed. When I moved to New York in 2009 to study at [The Interactive Telecommunications Program](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, I only had a vague notion of wanting to work in the intersection between art and code. As a Flash developer who primarily built banners for advertising, the two years at ITP completely changed my thinking. I would like to thank Dan'O Sullivan for his enormous support for this project, which started as a class at ITP, and is currently growing into its current form while I'm supported by ITP as a visiting resident. This book would not exist without the help and mentorship of Daniel Shiffman, whose dedication to his students is only surpassed by his talents in writing. I want to thank Stewart Smith, who taught the *Visualizing Data* class where the very idea for this book began. My thanks go to all of the ITP faculty who helped shape these ideas, including Danny Rozin, Clay Shirky, Tom Igoe, David Nolen, Gabe Barcia-Colombo, and George Agudow. A special thanks go to Lauren McCarthy, the original author of P5.js, and to Casey Reas and Ben Fry ....
