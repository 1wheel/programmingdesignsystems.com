  <p>Although it's a worthy exercise to focus solely on the <a href="{{ navigation.prev.href }}">size, position, and rotation</a> of a rectangle, we need to expand our toolset. We'll do this by taking a look at the three basic shapes and how they can be used in the design process.</p>

  <div class="three-grid">
    <figure class="col">
      {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/rectangle.js class:'fig' %}
    </figure>
    <figure class="col">
      {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/ellipse.js class:'fig' %}

    <figure class="col">
      {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/triangle.js class:'fig' %}
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p>Although we cannot ascribe absolute meaning to shapes, humans have a natural intuition towards them, shaped by a long history of cultural symbolism and iconology. If I draw a rectangle and an ellipse on a piece of paper, and I ask people which drawing is a depiction of the sun, an overwhelming majority would pick the ellipse. This is of course easy to explain: The ellipse is round, just like the sun. This tells us that the body of a shape has certain characteristics in and of itself. Let's spend a moment analyzing these characteristics for the three basic shapes.</p>

    <h1>Rectangle</h1>

    <p>The rectangle is a symmetric, solid shape with parallel lines. Not overly present in nature, it is the symbol of civilization itself, with a presence in almost every handmade object. We build cities in rectangular grids, houses as cubes with bricks, and our interiors are rectangles too: doors, shelves, and windows.</p>

    <p>The rectangle has been used throughout the history of the arts to set up basic constraints for the artist, with rectangular canvasses and grid systems to further divide this canvas into smaller squares. With the advent of computers, we use rectangular screens, and operate with a square as the smallest visual denomination: The pixel.</p>

        <figcaption>The squares in the Microsoft logo become a symbol for a window, a flag, and a pixelated screen.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The logo for the 8-bit musician Nullsleep has a rectangle on top of a pixelated font as a reference to both anti-authoritarianism and early computer art.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>In geometry, a rectangle consists of four points connected to form a closed shape with internal angles of 90 degrees. Instead of manually calculating these four points, the <code>rect()</code> function allows us to draw a rectangle with just the desired origin point and size of the rectangle. By default, the origin point will be the top left corner of the rectangle, but this can be changed using the <code>rectMode()</code> function.</p>

    <h1>Ellipse</h1>

    <p>The ellipse is a smooth, organic shape found many places in nature, in the shape of the sun, planets, raindrops, and the eyes of most animals. There is something calming in the shape of a circle, emphasizing no sense of direction. Human beings tend to gather in circles when trying to unite: We dance in circles, and design the seating of most parliaments in elliptical arrangements.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <figure class="col two-thirds">
        <img src="shape/basic-shapes/olympics.jpg" />
        <figcaption>The symbol for the Olympic Games by Pierre de Coubertin consists of five connected ellipses with colors taken from the flags of the participating countries from the 1912 games.</figcaption>

      <figure class="col one-third">

        <figcaption>The ABC logo by Paul Rand features a simple ellipse with an elliptical typeface.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Although an ellipse looks like a single curved shape, computers actually draw them using a series of short, straight connected lines around a center point. We use the <code>ellipse()</code> function to let P5.js do this for us, but you can easily replicate this technique by using <a href="#sine-and-cosine">Sine and Cosine.</a></p>

    <h1>Triangle</h1>

    <p>The triangle is an asymmetric shape, which makes it unique among the basic shapes for its directionality and sense of movement. It is commonly known as the symbol for both masculinity (▲) and femininity (▼), and it is widely used for its aesthetic qualitites. The great pyramids in Giza are famous depictions of the triangle, thought to act as both a symbol for the life-giving rays of the sun, and as a giant arrow pointing towards the assumed center of rotation of the stars, to which the Egyptians ascribed godly qualities.</p>

    <p>GRAPHIC DESIGN EXAMPLES.</p>

    <p>In geometry, the triangle is a special shape. It is widely used in Euclidian geometry and it serves as a foundation for all trigonometry, and there's simply no way of escaping it if you work with modern 2D or 3D graphics rendering.</p>

    <h1>An ice cream cone</h1>

    <p>I give my students the following exercise to practice the use of basic shapes: Design an ice cream cone in black and white using the <code>rect()</code>, <code>ellipse()</code>, and <code>triangle()</code> functions only once in your code.</p>

    <p>After seeing hundreds of solutions to this exercise, I have come to not only appreciate it as a great way for students to practice their design skills in a highly constrained way, but also a first important lesson on how design is both an objective and subjective artform. To demonstrate this, take a look at the two designs below. It doesn't require much effort to see that the design on the left looks the most like an ice cream cone. We can objectively say that it's the best design, even though the two designs use exactly the same shapes.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/cone-good.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/cone-bad.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>However, the solutions to this exercise can be extremely varied, ranging from simple icons to very clever representations. Looking at the examples below made by former students, it is much harder to say which design is the best, as they display a range of compositional techniques (which we'll investigate soon) resulting in unique styles. It's particularly interesting how they all are tiny design systems, driven by some algorithmic rule, whether that being rotation, repetition, or mirroring shapes placed by the <a href="#sine-and-cosine">Sine and Cosine</a> functions.</p>

    <div class="three-grid">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/cone-luisa.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>Design by Luisa Pereira.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/cone-shir.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>Design by Shir David.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/cone-tan.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>Design by Tan Ma.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>This is to say that the fundamentals of design is very objective, and you can learn basic compositional techniques by following a set of rules. However, we cannot fully evaulate design products by decomposing them into individual parts. This is especially true for digital design products, which are much more complex than their static predecessors. To tell whether something is a good or bad design product, we must see these parts as a system, and evaluate whether this system holistically makes sense for the purpose it is being used for. This too should be a guiding principle in the design process, where you should constantly analyze whether your implementation is creating a system that makes sense for the thing that you're trying to communicate. Without thinking – and analyzing the things that you see – code is but an excellent tool for creating complexity without reason.</p>

You do not know what you are looking for. You are lost. You are in a maze.
