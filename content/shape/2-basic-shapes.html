  <p>Although it's a worthy exercise to focus solely on the <a href="{{ navigation.prev.href }}">size, position, and rotation</a> of a rectangle, we need to expand our toolset. We'll do this by taking a look at the three basic shapes and how they can be used in the design process.</p>

  <div class="three-grid">
    <figure class="col">
      {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/rectangle.js class:'fig' %}
    </figure>
    <figure class="col">
      {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/ellipse.js class:'fig' %}
    </figure>
    <figure class="col">
      {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/triangle.js class:'fig' %}
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p>Although we cannot ascribe absolute meaning to shapes, humans have a natural intuition towards them, shaped by a long history of cultural symbolism and iconology. If I draw a rectangle and an ellipse on a piece of paper, and I ask people which drawing is a depiction of the sun, an overwhelming majority would pick the ellipse. This is of course easy to explain: The ellipse is round, just like the sun. This is true no matter what size or position I used for the shapes, because the body of a shape has certain characteristics in and of itself. Let's spend a moment analyzing these characteristics for the three basic shapes.</p>

    <h1>Rectangle</h1>

    <p>The rectangle is a symmetric, solid shape with parallel lines. Not overly present in nature, it is the symbol of civilization itself, with a presence in almost every handmade object. We build cities in rectangular grids, houses as cubes with bricks, and our interiors are rectangles too: doors, shelves, and windows.</p>

    <p>The rectangle has been used throughout the history of the arts to set up basic constraints for the artist, with rectangular canvasses and grid systems to further divide this canvas into smaller squares. With the advent of computers, we use rectangular screens, and operate with a square as the smallest visual denomination: The pixel.</p>

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>In geometry, a rectangle consists of four points connected to form a closed shape with internal angles of 90 degrees. Instead of manually calculating these four points, the <code>rect()</code> function allows us to easily draw a rectangle using just the desired origin point and size of the rectangle. By default, the origin point will be the top left corner of the rectangle, but this can be changed using <a href="http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rectMode"><code>rectMode()</code></a> function.</p>

    <h1>Ellipse</h1>

    <p>The ellipse is a smooth, organic shape found many places in nature, in the shape of the sun, planets, raindrops, and the eyes of most animals. There is something calming in the shape of a circle, emphasizing no sense of direction. Human beings tend to gather in circles when trying to unite: We dance in circles, and design the seating of most parliaments in elliptical arrangements.</p>

    <h1>Triangle</h1>

    <p>The triangle is an asymmetric shape, which makes it unique among the basic shapes for its directionality and sense of movement. It is commonly known as the symbol for both masculinity (▲) and femininity (▼), and it is widely used for its aesthetic qualitites. The great pyramids in Giza are famous depictions of the triangle, thought to act as both a symbol for the life-giving rays of the sun, and as a giant arrow pointing towards the assumed center of rotation of the stars, to which the Egyptians ascribed godly qualities.</p>

    <p>The triangle is also a symbol of Euclidian geometry, thus for mathematics itself, and it serves as the foundation for modern 2D and 3D graphics.</p>

    <h1>An ice cream cone</h1>

    <p>I give my students the following highly constrained exercise to practice the use of basic shapes: Design an ice cream cone in black and white using the <code>rect()</code>, <code>ellipse()</code>, and <code>triangle()</code> functions only once in your code.</p>

    <p>After seeing hundreds of solutions to this exercise, I have come to not only appreciate it as a great way for students to practice their design skills in a constrained way, but also a first important lesson on how good design can be both objective and highly subjective.</p>

    <p>To demonstrate this, take a look at the two designs below. It doesn't require much effort to see that the one on the left looks the most like an ice cream cone. We can objectively say that it's the best design, even though the two designs use exactly the same shapes.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/cone-good.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/basic-shapes/cone-bad.js class:'fig' %}
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>However, even though we're using just basic shapes and no color, the solutions to this exercise can be extremely varied, ranging from simple icons to very clever representations. Looking at the student work examples below, it is much harder to say which design is the best, as they are all in the individual style of each designer. They also display a range of compositional techniques, many of who we will look at in following chapters. Even though this is a very simple assignment, many students explore the possibilities of the medium, using `for` loops to create designs that are uniquely computational. (something about "interesting", and links to repetition and randomization). ALTHOUGH THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH, WE WILL SLOWLY GET THERE!</p>

    <p>This is to say that the fundamentals of design is very objective.... Execution is subjective. So how do we know whether something is right? -> Where is it being used? Design is finding the right form for the right content, and you must start by focusing on your content. Is it for an ice cream factory? Then many of the examples above are not great. Is it for xxxxx?</p>

    <blockquote>The design i s the product of your thinking. [..] But before you have focused your thoughts, you are all over the place, because you are searching. You are feeling. You are looking for things. You do no know what you are looking for. You are lost. You are in a maze. So thinking is the number on in the design process.<span data-type="footnote">Kroeger, Michael (2008) <em>Paul Rand: conversations with students</em>.
