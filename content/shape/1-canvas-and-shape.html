  <p>As we begin our journey into the field of graphic design, it's important to start at the very beginning. Graphic design is the art of using form and color to successfully convey a message, but this is not as easy as it sounds. The design process is one of trial and error, and it often takes many iterations to create a design that clearly communicates what you're trying to say. Although we tend to think of this design process as something involving gut instinct, experienced designers have an ever-expanding checklist of visual relationships that helps guide them through to the end.</p>

  <p>The first item on this checklist is learning how to manipulate a single shape to produce desired outcomes. We will investigate how changing three simple variables of a rectangle – the position, size, and rotation – can result in drastically different expressions. Although basic, these variables are an important first set of techniques to be employed at the beginning of every design process. Design students are much better off focusing solely on getting these simple relationships right, instead of searching through online portfolios for inspiration. So let's look at the canvas, some simple shape variables, and how all of this relates to programming.</p>

  <section data-type="sect1">

    <h1>Size</h1>

    <p>The size of a shape can be used to communicate whether that shape is important or not. Thus, by increasing the size of important shapes and decreasing the size of less important shapes, you can bring clarity to a design, and this is a pattern we encounter daily in everything from traffic signs to website dialog boxes.</p>

    <div class="two-grid">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/dominant.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>This square is dominant because it takes up most of the canvas.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/non-dominant.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>This square is less dominant because of the large empty space around it.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>A famous example of sizing in graphic design is Helmut Krone and William Bernbach's <em>Think Small</em> advertising campaign for Volkswagen. In this series of magazine ads, an image of the Volkwagen Beetle is printed in different sizes to emphasize the supporting text copy.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="shape/canvas-and-shape/vw-thinksmall.jpg" />
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="shape/canvas-and-shape/vw-lemon.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>You can reveal the underlying relationship of sizes by drawing black boxes on top of shapes in existing designs. This will highlight how sizing is an integral part of most successful designs, and how neglecting to think about sizing can lead to cluttered or unorganized layouts.</p>

    <p>TWO DESIGNS WITH BLACK BOXES, ONE SUCCESSFUL AND ONE NOT. BOTH TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING.</p>

    <p>All basic drawing functions in P5.js allows you to specify the size of the shape you're drawing. To draw a rectangle, we use the <code>rect(x, y, width, height)</code> function. In the following example, we draw a rectangle that takes up half the width of canvas.</p>

    <pre class="text-width"><code>createCanvas(500, 500);
rect(0, 0, 250, 500);</code></pre>

    <p>Although this code certainly works, it doesn't really do a good job describing the relationship between the canvas and the rectangle. If I were to change the size of the canvas, the rectangle would no longer span half the canvas. The title of this book, <em>Programming Design Systems</em>, refers to the fact that when we create graphic designs in code, we are not merely drawing something, but programming a system to draw something. It is therefore up to us, the designers, to write our code so it is flexible, easy to understand, and easy to improve upon. In this case, you can make your code more flexible by calculating the size of your rectangle with the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> variables. These variables are created for you by P5.js, and they will always hold the size of the canvas.</p>

    <pre class="text-width"><code>createCanvas(500, 500);
rect(0, 0, width/2, height);</code></pre>

    <p>The code above produces the same result, but it makes sure that the rectangle resizes based on the size of the canvas. This method is used throughout this book, as it's simply good practice, and it will make it easier for you to test variations of your code-based designs.</p>

    <h1>Position</h1>

    <p>Like words in a paragraph of text, the position of a shape indicates the order of the shape in the design. Most written languages have a natural reading direction, and this can be used to prioritize the importance of shapes, and tell the user where to start reading.</p>

    <p>This pattern is used throughout the design world to create, in lack of a better word, rhythm. Graphic novels use the positioning of captions to guide the reader through the storyline. Newspapers place the most important text in a heading at the top of an article, which also tends to have a larger size to set it apart. Notice also how changing the position of shapes also changes the whitespace between them, which can be used to create both balance and asymmetry.</p>

    <div class="two-grid">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/left.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>First, because of reading direction.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/right.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>Last, because of reading direction.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>In these posters for Swiss Auto Club, Joseph Müller-Brockmann uses both position and size to prioritize certain shapes. On the left, the vehicle is emphasized to heighten the tension, making it apparent that the vehicle is on a collision course with the kid. On the right, the bicycle is emphasized to achieve the exact opposite.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="shape/canvas-and-shape/brockmann-motorbike.jpg" />
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="shape/canvas-and-shape/brockmann-bicycle.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>To position 2D shapes in code, we use the concept of a coordinate system, where shapes are given <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values that determine their position. To demonstrate best practice, take the following image.</p>

    <figure class="text-width">
      {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/use-variables.js class:'fig' %}
    </figure>

    <p>We could easily implement this like the following code, where we correctly rely on the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> variables to position the rectangle near the bottom right corner of the canvas.</p>

    <pre class="text-width"><code>rect(width - 150, height - 150, 100, 100);</code></pre>

    <p>However, even though the position of the rectangle is dynamic, the size is not. In the following example, we use the size of the canvas to calculate the size of the rectangle.</p>

    <pre class="text-width"><code>rect(width - (height*0.4), height - (height*0.4), height * 0.3, height * 0.3);</code></pre>

    <p>There is one big problem with the code above: It has become very hard to read. If you need to change the position of the rectangle, it will take you a while to mentally parse what's going on. To solve this problem, it is often helpful to use variables at the top of your code to store these numbers. This not only makes the code more readable, but it also makes it easier to test variations of your design. The following example generates the same design, but all numbers are now saved into variables with names that make sense.</p>

    {% codesplit shape/canvas-and-shape/use-variables.js lines:'6-10,13' class:'text-width' %}

    <p>Keeping your code organized is very important, especially as you start to write more sophisticated code.</p>

    <h1>Rotation</h1>

    <p>Rotation can be used to make shapes come alive, as the whitespace around them becomes more complex and breaks the symmetry of the design.</p>

    <div class="three-grid">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/rotation1.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>A rectangle with no rotation appears static because of the symmetric whitespace.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/rotation2.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>A rotation of 45&deg; creates more complex – but still symmetric – whitespace.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/rotation3.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>A rotation of 27&deg; breaks the symmetry, and the rectangle appears in motion.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Rotation is used in many types of design products: Children's books use rotated shapes to make them look fun and playful. Popular magazines use rotated grid systems to make the content look less dry, while publications for a narrow target audience use horizontal grid systems to imply quality of the content within.</p>

    <div class="two-grid header-width">
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="shape/canvas-and-shape/rand-iknow.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Paul Rand uses rotation to make a playful cover for a children's book.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        <img src="shape/canvas-and-shape/adidas.jpg" />
        <figcaption>The podium in the Adidas logo is rotated to convey speed and dynamism.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>In code, we rotate shapes by calling the <code>rotate()</code> function before drawing the shapes that need to be rotated. This function expects the rotation to be defined in radians, but it's often helpful to use the <code>radians()</code> function to convert degrees into radians. The following code will rotate all following shapes by 90 degrees.</p>

    <pre class="text-width"><code>rotate(radians(90));</code></pre>

    <p>It's important to understand that when you use the <code>rotate()</code> function, you are not rotating individual shapes. Instead, you are rotating the entire coordinate system, and because the shapes are drawn within the coordinate system, the shapes are rotated too. Combined with <code>translate()</code>, which moves the origin of the coordinate system, it's possible to achieve very different outcomes, as demonstrated in the following examples.</p>

    <div class="commentator">
      {% codesplit shape/canvas-and-shape/coordinates.js lines:'11-17' %}
      <figure>{% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/coordinates.js class:'fig' %}</figure>
    </div>

    <div class="commentator">
      {% codesplit shape/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-rotated.js lines:'6-12,17' %}
      <figure>{% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-rotated.js class:'fig' %}</figure>
    </div>

    <div class="commentator">
      {% codesplit shape/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-translated.js lines:'6-13,18' %}
      <figure>{% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-translated.js class:'fig' %}</figure>
    </div>

    <div class="commentator">
      {% codesplit shape/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-translated-rotated.js lines:'6-13,18' %}
      <figure>{% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/coordinates-translated-rotated.js class:'fig' %}</figure>
    </div>

    <p>As we dive into more layout techniques, we will further investigate how to use <code>translate()</code> and <code>rotate()</code> to make more sophisticated designs.</p>

    <h1>Designing a word</h1>

    <p>You can practice these techniques by picking an adjective from the dictionary and make a design for it by changing the position, size, and rotation of a single rectangle. This helps you build one of the most fundamental skills in graphic design: The ability to create visual relationships that make sense for your content.</p>

    <p>As a simple example, let's take the word <em>steep</em>. How would you make a design for this word using just a rectangle and the three variables? Start by looking for connections between the word and your variables, and you'll notice that steepness and rotation are related: You can make the rectangle appear like a steep hill by rotating it. By changing the size, you can make that hill longer, continuing outside the canvas. By changing the position of the rectangle, you can create asymmetric whitespace, making sure that the user notices the rectangle.</p>

    <div class="three-grid">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/steep1.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>1. First we rotate the rectangle until it looks steep.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/steep2.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>2. Then we change the size to make it go beyond the canvas.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/steep3.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>3. Then we draw attention to the rectangle by moving it away from the center.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>As the following examples shows, you can use this process to practice coming up with interesting visual solutions. Some adjectives are hard to make designs for with just a single shape, and you can find yourself longing for more shapes. That's perfect, as it's the subject of the next article. Here's a few more word designs for inspiration.</p>

    <div class="three-grid">
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/flat.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>Flat</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/big.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>Big</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="col">
        {% p5 shape/canvas-and-shape/shy.js class:'fig' %}
        <figcaption>Shy</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Although this is just our first step into the world of graphic design, many extra-ordinary works of art have been created using this approach. It's also common to find problems in existing designs that can be traced back to the use of position, size, and rotation. Whether it's a user interface that fails to emphasize an important button, or a graph with ambiguity around its underlying dataset, it's clear that some designers rush to make things pretty without thinking about these basic relationships. This should be seen as a failure of design, and one is much better off including these ideas as a vital part of any design process.</p>
